Thanks to Ashutosh Tripati

1)Download docker desktop and start docker desktop

2)Install minikube https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/ 
Note: Follow the both the instructions in the above link, Run as administrator from powershell, 
After this step we can see a folder in C: drive 'C:\minikube'

3) To start minikube from powershell run the below command (ensure docker desktop running) 
minikube start 
Note: The above step will download containers in the docker desktop, it will take around 5 mins

4) Check if the minikue is started by running the below command from cmd prompt
kubectl get po -A

5) To deploy the Kubeflow Pipelines on local cluster environment, run the following commands, refer the link below: 
https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/v1/installation/localcluster-deployment/#deploying-kubeflow-pipelines

# env/platform-agnostic-pns hasn't been publically released, so you will install it from master
export PIPELINE_VERSION=2.0.1
kubectl apply -k "github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/manifests/kustomize/cluster-scoped-resources?ref=$PIPELINE_VERSION"
kubectl wait --for condition=established --timeout=60s crd/applications.app.k8s.io
kubectl apply -k "github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/manifests/kustomize/env/platform-agnostic-pns?ref=$PIPELINE_VERSION"

Note: The above step will take 15 to 20 mins


6) Verify that the Kubeflow Pipelines UI is accessible by port-forwarding:
kubectl port-forward -n kubeflow svc/ml-pipeline-ui 8080:80

7)Test if its up from localhost:8080
